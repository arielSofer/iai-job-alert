# IAI Student Job Alert Platform Walkthrough

I have successfully built the IAI Student Job Alert Platform. This platform allows students to subscribe to email alerts for new job postings in their residential area.

## Changes Implemented

### Backend
- **Server**: Express.js server ([src/server.js](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/src/server.js)) handling API requests and serving the frontend.
- **Database**: SQLite database ([src/database.js](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/src/database.js)) storing users, jobs, and notification history.
- **Scraper**: A robust Puppeteer-based scraper ([src/scraper.js](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/src/scraper.js)) that fetches jobs from the IAI website, supporting pagination and location filtering.
- **Notifier**: An email notification system ([src/notifier.js](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/src/notifier.js)) using `nodemailer`.

### Frontend
- **UI**: A clean, responsive web interface ([public/index.html](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/public/index.html), [public/style.css](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/public/style.css)) for users to subscribe.
- **Logic**: JavaScript ([public/app.js](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/public/app.js)) to fetch available locations dynamically and handle form submission.

### Immediate Notification
- **Feature**: When a user subscribes, the system immediately triggers a job check for their location.
- **Benefit**: New users receive an email with all currently available jobs right away.
- **Verification**: Verified that a new user (`curl_test_2@example.com`) received an immediate email with 5 jobs upon subscription.

## Verification Results

### User Registration Flow
I verified the user registration flow using a browser subagent.

1.  **Navigation**: Successfully loaded the homepage.
2.  **Form Interaction**: Selected "יהוד" as the location and entered a test email.
3.  **Submission**: Submitted the form and received the success message: "נרשמת בהצלחה! תקבל עדכון כשתיפתח משרה באזורך."
4.  **Immediate Check**: Confirmed that the server triggers [processLocation](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/src/server.js#97-150) immediately upon subscription.

### Scraper Logic
The scraper logic was implemented to handle the specific URL structure of the IAI jobs site.
- **Puppeteer**: Switched from Axios/Cheerio to Puppeteer to bypass bot detection (User-Agent blocking) and ensure reliable scraping.
- **Selectors**: Updated to use robust selectors (`h3 > a[href^="/job/"]`) identified via browser inspection.

### Email Configuration
- **Mailjet**: Configured `nodemailer` to use Mailjet SMTP (`in-v3.mailjet.com`) with the provided API Key and Secret Key.
- **Sender**: Updated [src/notifier.js](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/src/notifier.js) to use the verified sender address `arielvdcr@gmail.com`.
- **Verification**: Confirmed that emails are successfully sent through Mailjet.

## Next Steps
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a server (e.g., Heroku, Render). Note that Puppeteer requires a buildpack with Chrome dependencies.
- **Sender Verification**: Ensure the "From" address in [src/notifier.js](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/src/notifier.js) is a verified sender in your Mailjet account to avoid delivery issues.
- **Cron Job**: The server is configured to check for jobs every hour. This can be adjusted in [src/server.js](file:///Users/ariels/.gemini/antigravity/brain/5eb768e9-7559-405a-a4f8-fda1d5f235da/src/server.js).
